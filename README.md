# Justin's Sports Site
## The Main Idea
this site is intended to help compare 2 players, for fantasy football/basketball reasons, or for just plain old arguing about who was better, Jerry Rice, or Randy Moss?

## Minimum Viable Product
main site will offer selection between basketball and football
on each sport's page, there will be two dropdowns, where the players would be selected
it would bring up a list of stats, with the "winner" of each category being denoted by an icon

## Future Features:
login/register
save a fantasy team/find Free agents in your fantasy league
the ability to set players as favorite players
search for certain players in each dropdown
more sports/leagues
